Here's a poem about cricket:

**The Gentleman's Game**

On emerald fields where leather meets willow,
The bowler's run builds like thunder's roar,
While fielders crouch in patterns they know,
And the keeper waits behind stumps of lore.

The batsman stands, shoulders squared and steady,
Eyes tracking the red sphere's spinning flight,
His grip on the handle firm and ready
To send it soaring into summer light.

Six balls an over, the rhythm keeps time,
As crowds cheer boundaries and wickets that fall,
Each delivery a verse, each match a rhyme
In cricket's eternal, lyrical call.

From village greens to Test match grounds,
The game flows on through centuries long,
Where honor and sport in tradition are bound,
And every match tells its own stirring song.

The stumps stand sentinel, three wooden guards,
While slips wait patient for the telling edge,
In this theater of runs and bowling yards
Where legends are made and heroes pledge.
